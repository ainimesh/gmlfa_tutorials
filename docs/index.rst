   This Project is currently under developement! If you are interested to contribute, create a pull request of the project github.


For this course, we created a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to help you understanding the "theory" from the lectures by seeing corresponding implementations.
We will see and understand various topics in graph machine learning such as different graph neural network architectures etc. (full list will be provided below!)

The notebooks are there to help you understand the material and teach you details of the **PyTorch** framework, **Torch-Geometric** framework and **DGL** framework, including **PyTorch Lightning**.

We encourage you to get familiar with the notebooks and experiment or extend them yourself.
Further, the content presented will be relevant for the graded assignment and exam.

How to run the notebooks
------------------------

On this website, you will find the notebooks exported into a HTML format so that you can read them from whatever device you prefer. However, we suggest that you also give them a try and run them yourself. There are three main ways of running the notebooks we recommend:
- **Locally on CPU**: to be added
- **Locally on GPU**: to be added
- **Google Colab**: to be added

Tutorial-Lecture alignment
--------------------------
to be added soon


Feedback, Questions or Contributions
------------------------------------

We present these tutorials as a self study for the Graph Machine Learning Foundation and Applications course. As with any other project, small bugs and issues are expected. We appreciate any feedback from students, whether it is about a spelling mistake, implementation bug, or suggestions for improvements/additions to the notebooks. Please use the following [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAxJLKn_4kl6oPOcM0SI10wI2Av5rrs1wG3ZQ-MECgo/edit?usp=sharing) to submit feedback, or feel free to reach out to me directly per mail (animesh dot sachan24794 at gmail dot com), or talk to me during any TA session.
