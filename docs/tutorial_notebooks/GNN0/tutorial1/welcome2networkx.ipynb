    "Welcome to our NetworkX tutorial for the Graph Machine Learning course at the IIT Kharagpur! The following notebook is meant to give an introduction to NetworkX, and get you setup for creating your own graphs and understanding them in depth. NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are of course not the first ones to create tutorial on NetworkX. There are many great tutorials online, and on the official [NetworkX website](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html). Yet, we choose to create our own tutorial which is designed to give you the basics particularly necessary for the practicals, but still understand how NetworkX works under the hood. Over the next upcoming tutorials we will keep on exploring more features of NetworkX in the series of Jupyter notebook tutorials about Graph Machine Learning. \n",

    "We will use a set of standard libraries that are often used in graph machine learning projects. If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, all libraries should be pre-installed. If you are running this notebook locally, make sure you have installed our `gmlfa_cpu` environment and have activated it."
